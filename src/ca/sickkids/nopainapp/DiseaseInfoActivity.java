	String cancer = "What is cancer?\nCancer is not just one disease. There are over 100 different types of cancer, each with different names, effects, and treatments. Even though each type of cancer is different, there are some basic things that are similar to most cancers. \n\nIn order to understand more about cancer, you first need to understand a bit about cells.\n\nWhat are cells?\nCells are the building blocks of the body. They are very small and can only be seen under a microscope. There are billions of cells in a fully grown human body. Not every cell is the same. There are hundreds of different kinds of cells in the body and each has a different job. For example, bone cells are different from skin cells, which are different from muscle cells. The cells work together to form organs like the heart, the brain, or intestines.\n\nEven though cells do different jobs in our body, they still have some similarities. Each cell has something called a nucleus that contains DNA. The DNA contains genes that are like instructions for our cells. DNA tells cells what to do and how and when to do it. Genes within the DNA tell the cells when to reproduce (make copies of themselves) and when to die. If a cell is damaged, instructions in the DNA tell the cell either how to repair itself, or if it is too damaged, that it is time for the cell to die. \n\nHow do cells reproduce?\nCells reproduce through a process called cell division. In cell division, the cell copies all it\u2019s DNA and then divides into two identical cells. Normally, cells only reproduce to replace other cells that have died or to make more cells when your body is growing. This way, your body carefully regulates how many cells there are in your body. \n\nDifferent types of cells reproduce at different rates. For example, cells in your mouth and that line your stomach and intestines live a short time and reproduce very often. Cells in your brain and spinal cord, called neurons, live a long time and in adults they almost never reproduce.\n\nCells and cancer\nCancer happens when there is a change in the DNA (genes) in a normal cell called a mutation. The mutation causes the cell to act differently than a normal cell. The mutated cells do not die when they should. They reproduce even when the body does not need them to, usually much faster than normal cells. The cancerous cell reproduces over and over again, forming two cells, then four, then eight, then 16, until it has made billions of copies of itself. Each of the copies has the same mutation. \n\nHow cancer spreads\nThe place the cancer first started in the body is known as the primary cancer site. We call this group of cancer cells the primary cancer. These cancer cells can break away and travel to other parts of the body through the blood or lymph vessels. When cancer cells start to travel in the body, it is called metastasis. Sometimes these cells can get stuck in other tissues in the body and will then start to grow in this new place in the body. This new group of cells is called the secondary cancer site. \n\nWhat causes cancer?\nScientists are searching for the answer to what causes cancer. For most cancers though, especially for cancers in young people, we still do not know what causes them. We do know that cancer IS NOT contagious. You cannot catch cancer and cancer does not spread from one person to the next.\n\nRemember, having cancer yourself does not mean that your brothers, sisters, friends, or parents will get cancer. Very, very rarely, cancer can be caused by a mutation in the genes of your DNA that was passed on through your family. Having this mutated gene does not mean that a person will definitely get cancer, but it can increase the risk of developing a cancer.\n\nDo all cancers need treatment?\nAs you now know, cancer is not just one disease. In fact, there are hundreds of different types of cancer and within each type of cancer there can be a lot of variety depending on: \n\u2022\twhere the cancer is growing in the body \n\u2022\thow fast it is growing\n\u2022\thow different the cancer cells are from normal cells \n\u2022\twhether the cancer has spread to another part of the body\n\u2022\thow your body is responding to the cancer \n\nCancer is a life-threatening disease and so most cancers do require treatment. Often they need to be treated as fast as possible.\n\nHow will cancer affect me now?\nYour cancer and its treatment will likely have effects on how your body feels and the way it works. The way you feel about your body might change too. Lots of young people describe feeling a bunch of different emotions all at once:\n\u2022\tShock that cancer is happening to you\n\u2022\tScared about what\u2019s going to happen\n\u2022\tUncertain about what cancer is and what treatment means\n\u2022\tConfused and wondering \u201cWhy me? Why now?\u201d\n\u2022\tWorried about the future, your family, about missing school, your friends, about losing your hair, and about a million other things.\n\nTo be sad, worried, scared, nervous, shocked, lonely or just plain mad is normal. You may feel happy and positive one day and sad and angry the next. No matter what you are feeling, know that you are not the only young person with cancer who feels this way. Just remember that cancer is not your fault and there is no right or wrong way to feel.\n\nBut one thing that doesn\u2019t change is who you are. You are still the same person you were before cancer.\nAlong with your family, your doctors, nurses, social workers, and the rest of the health care team are there to support you. They are trained to look after your body, but they also want to help you with all the other effects of cancer too. This program will talk about many of the effects of cancer and how to deal with them. ";
	
	String scd = "What is Sickle Cell Disease?\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of disorders that affect your blood. It is an inherited disorder. One out of 500 African Americans and one out of 1,000 Hispanic Americans are born with SCD each year. This means that SCD is passed on from parents to children through their DNA and that children are born with SCD. To understand SCD better you have understand a little bit about cells. \n\nWhat are cells?\nCells are the building blocks of the body. They are very small and can only be seen under a microscope. There are billions of cells in a fully-grown human body. Not every cell is the same. There are hundreds of different kinds of cells in the body and each has a different job. For example, bone cells are different from skin cells, which are different from muscle cells. The cells work together to form organs like the heart, the brain, or intestines.\n\nOne special type of cell is the red blood cell (sometimes called RBC by your health care team). RBCs are the cells in our blood that give it its red colour. As part of our blood RBCs have a very important role. They carry oxygen from our lungs to every other part of our body. The other cells in our body need this oxygen to function well. Cells need oxygen all the time. They need oxygen when we are sleeping and they need even more oxygen when we are exercising (because they are working so hard). \nIn the case of SCD, the RBCs take on an unusual shape. We say that the cells are \u2018sickled\u2019 in shape, meaning that they are not as smooth and round. \n\nWhat are the symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease?\nBecause the RBCs are sickled, they can clump together and block blood flow in your veins and arteries. Although SCD can affect almost any organ in your body, the problem that bothers most young people is called a vaso-occlusive crisis (or a VOC). A VOC is actually when the sickle cells clump up and it can cause young people a lot of pain. It happens about 5-7 times a year in most people with SCD. In fact, pain is the most common and bothersome symptom experienced by young people with SCD. \n\nOn top of VOC, there are other health problems that can happen in people with SCD. These include:\n\u2022\tLow numbers of RBCs (or the things that make up RBCs) in your blood making you feel weak and tired\n\u2022\tInfections and getting sick\n\nIf you are having any of these symptoms, you should take them very seriously contact your health care team or go to the hospital. \nSome of the symptoms you might have are extremely serious and you should tell someone about them immediately and call 9-1-1. Some of these serious symptoms are:\n\u2022\tSuddenly feeling dizzy and not like yourself\n\u2022\tTalking weird (like slurring your words)\n\u2022\tFainting\n\u2022\tWeakness in your arms or legs\n\u2022\tChest pain and feeling like its hard to breath\n\u2022\tVery bad headaches\n\u2022\tVomiting that will not stop\n\nHow can you deal with the symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease?\nYour health care team is there to help you. You should follow their advice and talk to them about any problems that you may have dealing with SCD. \n\nOne very important thing you can do is to drink lots of fluids so you\u2019re not thirsty. This is especially important when you are exercising. Eating healthy foods is also a really good idea.\n\nIf you are having a painful VOC (or any other health problem caused by SCD) you are going to need help form your health care team. Medications may be needed to help you and you might even have to spend time in the hospital.  It is important to remember that your health care team does not know about any of the SCD problems you are having if you do not tell them. Also, you can do other things to monitor and manage your pain; such as using this app and the recommendations it gives you. \n\nYour health care team might also give you other medications and vitamins to take and you may also need RBC transfusions. These transfusions are when someone else\u2019s blood that does not have sickled cells is given to you. You will have to stay in the hospital or a clinic for a while to have this transfusion. These transfusions are done to lower the amount of sickle cells in you blood. Some young people have transfusions every once in a while and some young people get them quite frequently.  \n\nHow will Sickle Cell Disease affect your future?\nTaking good care of yourself is the best thing you can do. This means that you need to eating healthy, drinking lots of fluids, getting enough sleep, monitoring and telling your health care team about your symptoms and controlling pain when you have it. \nDoing these things will help to keep you as healthy as possible and will let you do the things you want to do with your life. Your health care team will monitor your SCD symptoms and work with you to keep you as healthy as possible.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you share with the other young people what having SCD means to you? You can use social media like Facebook or Twitter from this app.";
	
	String jia = "What Is JIA?\nThe word arthritis comes from the Greek words \"arthron\" meaning \"joint,\" and \"itis,\" meaning inflammation. A joint is the place where two bones are joined, or come together. Inflammation occurs when the body reacts to infection, irritation or other injury, Symptoms of inflammation include redness, warmth, swelling and pain. Arthritis means you have inflammation in your joints. \n\nMany people think that arthritis is something that only old people get. Children and teenagers get a type of arthritis called juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). \u201cJuvenile\u201d means young (younger than age 16) and \u201cidiopathic\u201d means the cause is not known. JIA is also sometimes called juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). \n\nHere are some differences between arthritis in young people and arthritis in adults:\n\u2022\tOsteoarthritis, a common form of arthritis in adults, is not common in young people with JIA. \n\u2022\tIt may take longer for young people with JIA to be diagnosed because many people (even doctors) don\u2019t realize young people can get arthritis \n\u2022\tArthritis in young people may affect their growth. \n\u2022\tPatients with JIA may also get inflammation in their eyes. \n\u2022\tMedications used to treat JIA are generally the same in all age groups. However, doses are adjusted for children and adolescents based on their weight. \n\nHow does JIA affect the joints?\nIn a healthy joint, a special sac called the articular capsule surrounds the space between two bones. The lining of this sac is called the synovial lining. The synovial lining makes a fluid that keeps the joint slippery. This fluid is similar to motor oil that keeps the parts of a car engine working properly. The ends of the bones are covered with a smooth substance called cartilage. The cartilage allows the bone ends to glide easily across each other. \n\nIn JIA, changes in the immune system cause the lining of the sac to become inflamed and thickened. Extra fluid is produced, which contains inflammatory cells. These inflammatory cells make and release substances that can cause the symptoms of joint inflammation. These symptoms include warmth, stiffness, swelling, and pain. If left untreated, joint inflammation can damage the cartilage and underlying bone. \n\nCommon symptoms of JIA\nYoung people with JIA have many common symptoms, including:\n\u2022\tJoint swelling\n\u2022\tJoint pain \n\u2022\tStiffness, or difficulty moving the joints \n\u2022\tFatigue, which means feeling tired all day long \n\u2022\tSleep difficulties \n\nYour symptoms can affect your daily activities. You may find it hard to get dressed, or go to school or work. It might be difficult to play sports or do other fun activities. Like many other young people with JIA, you might also feel isolated, helpless, or depressed. \nJIA affects each person differently. You might not have all of these symptoms. Your symptoms may also vary in how much they affect you. \n\nFlares and remissions\nWhen your joint becomes inflamed, you may have one or all of these symptoms. If your inflammation gets worse, it is called a flare (or flare-up). If the inflammation in your joint goes away, it is called a remission.\nYou may have day-to-day changes in symptoms but that does not mean you are having a flare-up of your JIA. For example, one morning you might find your joints stiff and sore. The next day you may have no morning stiffness or pain. A flare is when you have an increase in inflammation for a prolonged period.\n\nHow Will JIA Affect Your Future?\nIt is impossible for your doctor to really predict whether your JIA will go away, or whether you will have it as an adult. In general though, about 70% of young people with JIA will have active arthritis as adults. Also, the longer your disease remains active, the greater the risk that you will have joint damage. \n\nThe good news is that almost all young people with JIA can control their arthritis with medicines and other treatments. This means that you should be able to do all of the things you want to do. Your health care team will monitor your JIA symptoms and work with you to keep your joints as healthy as possible.\n\n Why don\u2019t you share with the other young people what having JIA means to you? You can use social media like Facebook or Twitter from this app.";
	
	String pain = "What is pain?\n\nPain is a part of many illnesses that cause distress and fear.  Many people think that if you have certain health conditions, you are bound to have pain and that nothing can be done to relieve it.  This is not true. With the help of your medical team, pain can be prevented or reduced so that you can do the activities that are important to you. \nHave you ever wondered why you feel pain? Pain is the body\'s warning system, alerting you that something is wrong. Nerve cells, also called neurons, transmit signals from all the senses including pain. Specialized pain neurons are found throughout the skin and other body tissues. When the pain neurons are stimulated, electrical and chemical signals travel through nerves in the spinal cord to the brain and are interpreted as pain.\n \nAcute pain is called ordinary or nociceptive pain. It is a useful sensation because it protects us from hurting ourselves. If we did not feel pain, we might burn our fingers on the stove or not know when we have a serious problem. \nAcute pain is what you feel when normal nerves send messages from the injured body tissues. This is the type of pain you feel from a needle poke for blood work, or in an inflamed joint. This pain is temporary, lasting minutes to several weeks. Acute pain goes away when healing occurs. \n\nChronic pain refers to pain that has lasted for at least three months. Unlike acute pain, chronic pain does not serve a useful purpose like warning us about something harmful. Some kinds of chronic pain are not due to normal nerves reporting that tissues are injured or inflamed. Instead, these other kinds of pain, called nerve or neuropathic pain, are due to abnormal messages being sent to the brain by the nerves. This can happen even when the tissue is no longer inflamed or injured. \n\nLet\u2019s look at how we feel pain. Experts believe that there are many important reasons for why your pain might persist, including:\n\u2022\tYour physiology, or the way your body is made up \n\u2022\tThe way your body responds to physical and emotional stress \n\u2022\tYour mood and beliefs \n\u2022\tThe way that parents and friends respond to you \nThe good news is that you can learn new ways of thinking, feeling, and acting. These can help change the way that your body feels pain. \n\nWhat can be done to reduce pain?\n\nThe 3 P\u2019s of pain reduction:\n\nPharmacological methods: Medications to lessen the pain. Called analgesics, these medications decrease the sensation of pain. Different medications are used to reduce different types of pain. Some are used to reduce nociceptive pain and some are used to reduce neuropathic pain. Some are used to treat mild pain and some are used to treat severe pain. Also, your health team may use combinations of medications to help with your pain. Read below to learn about some of these medications. It is important to review this information and take any questions you may have about medications to your health team for clarification. \n\u2022\tNociceptive Pain: this type of pain is more common than neuropathic pain and can be treated with a variety of different medications. \no\tMild nociceptive pain: Simple analgesics, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be used to relieve mild pain. Remember to take these according to the instructions your heath team gave you.\no\tModerate nociceptive pain: For moderate pain, simple analgesics can be used with mild opioid medicine. Remember to take these according to the instructions your heath team gave you.\no\tSevere nociceptive pain: Opioids (also known as narcotics) such as morphine and hydromorphone (Dilaudid) are given for stronger pain. Opioids work on the brain, changing your perception of pain signals.  Like most medicines, opioids have side effects. These include slowing your breathing, sleepiness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and itchiness. It is important to discuss the benefits and side effects of any drug with your doctor.  \n\u2022\tSide note on \u201caddiction\u201d: you may fear that you might get addicted to the opioids prescribed to you.  Addiction refers to taking a substance for its mind altering effects (high, euphoria) and not because you are in actual pain.  As long as you continue to have pain, you won\u2019t become addicted to opioids.  You may require a slow decrease of medication once your pain is lessened to avoid unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, but this does not mean you were addicted.  \n\u2022\tNeuropathic pain: this type of pain is different from other pain and requires different medication.  Gabapentin (Neurontin) which is a medicine used for seizures is quite effective in reducing neuropathic pain. Small doses of certain \u201cadjuvant\u201d (or additional helper) medications such as amitriptyline (Elavil) are also often used.  These do not work immediately like other pain medications and can take up to 5 days to start working.\n\nPhysical methods: a physical therapist may be asked to help with pain that comes from muscles and nerves. They can show you exercises and stretches to help reduce body and muscle pain.  Other ways of reducing pain include the use of heat, cold, or massage.  \n\nPsychological methods: using your mind you can change your feelings and understanding of your pain.  As healthcare professional such as a psychologist may help you learn some of the psychological methods to help with pain. You can use methods like distraction, talking with others or imagery during pain episodes or painful procedures to help you deal with pain. Even building your knowledge about pain and painful procedures can help with pain.  \n\nAll 3 P\u2019s can be used together to help reduce as much of your pain as possible.\n\nYour health care team will help you but you should be involved in decisions about how pain is managed.  Most of all, you need to understand your pain management plan. Whenever you are not in the hospital, this app can help you keep track of the times and amounts of pain you have. It also helps you learn about which pain management strategies help you personally to deal with pain. Bring this app to your health team when you have appointments. You are an expert on your pain! Using the information on this app, you and your health team can work together to build the best pain management plan possible.";
