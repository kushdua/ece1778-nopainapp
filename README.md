Introduction 

Need for a Smartphone-based pain self-management intervention. Chronic or persistent pain affects 25-35% of adolescents 
and young adults (AYA) and is now recognized as a disease. Pain may be the result of a variety of chronic and 
life-limiting health conditions (e.g. arthritis, cancer) or its cause may be unknown. If left untreated this pain results 
in high distress ratings, social and mental health problems, poor academic performance and increased utilization of 
healthcare services. Despite advancements in the amount and quality of pain management research, persistent pain in 
adolescents continues to be poorly controlled. 
Self-management represents a means to improve pain outcomes for AYA. Self-management is defined as an “individual’s ability
to manage the consequences and lifestyle changes inherent in living with a chronic condition”. The content of 
self-management interventions typically includes disease-related education, social-support, symptom management education 
and decision-making support. Importantly however, patient access to pain self-management programming is limited due to 
difficulties accessing services and cost. Smartphone-based pain self-management represents a means to circumvent these 
accessibility issues and better manage pain in AYA. 

Project goal

The goal of this project was to design and build a Smartphone-based (Android platform) application to aid AYA in 
self-managing chronic and persistent pain. In doing so, we developed the NOpain app with the functionalities necessary 
(based on current scientific evidence8) to successfully support AYA in managing pain. The NOPain app is highly applicable 
to the nursing discipline, which is interested in pain management, and the wider health community (i.e., patients, families, other clinicians).  

Page Description 

1. Log-in :
User-identification and password allows access to NOpain. Users can register new accounts, providing them their own unique 
settings, calendar and survey storage.

2. Home :
Provides direct links to NOpain self-managment functionalities. Credits to course, apper, programmers are displayed in 
placeholder of potential future SickKids branding.

3. Pain survey and recommendations :
Pain is self-reported via survey. Based on data entered into the survey, tailored pain management recommendations are given. Pain re-assessment occurs post-initial recommendation. All data are stored locally, and in the future can be transferred to external SickKids databases for storage and evaluation by an AYA’s healthteam.

4. Calendar :
The calendar is integrated with the Google Calendar platform to allow tracking of upcoming pain surveys and clinic visits.
The calendar displays recurrent surveys at times specified by the user in settings. All entries displayed in NOpain’s 
calendar event list are visible through the native Calendar app, as NOpain uses the native Calendar Provider libraries. 
Users may also clear their calendar (i.e., delete all user-set appointments, leaving only twice-daily recurring surveys).
 
5. Goal-setting :
Clinical goals (e.g., walk a block every day this week) can be entered by users.  Goals can be tracked manually over time 
and discussed using social media. Historical pain ratings can be graphed for review/reflection by AYA. 
 
6. Journal :
Thoughts, experiences and progress can be recorded in text and/or video format (both stored locally on external phone 
memory partition). Functionality for display and playback of video journal entries is also present. 
 
7. Social support :
Twitter and Facebook can be launched by directly from NOpain to allow communication between AYA (and others) about pain 
and individual progress.
 
8 Disease education :
Educational materials about pain and an AYA’s painful condition (e.g., cancer) are available for 
review. The appropriate material is shown based on the underlying pain condition the user indicated in their settings 
(i.e., General Pain, Cancer, Sickle Cell Disease, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis).
 
9 Settings :
AYA can customize/personalize their health condition (used for health education modules) and time of recurring (i.e. daily)
surveys in NOpain. All settings are linked to the user account, and stored locally in a database.

Future Work

1. Polish user-interface. Some undesirable features of the interface should be refined (e.g., spacing of selectable 
pain management recommendations). To improve the user experience, the interface and functionality (corner cases) 
should be polished/refined. 

2. User-centred usability testing. User-centred testing is necessary to develop an app that is well-used. Conducting usability testing with AYA would allow us to: (1) change functionalities, (2) refine the design and interface, (3) ensure NOpain is understandable and (4) reveal and address NOpain technical issues. 

3. Effectiveness testing. To be adopted by patients and clinicians on a wide-scale, rigorous testing (i.e., a randomized control trial) is necessary to establish NOpain’s clinical effectiveness. 

4. Integration with hospital databases. Ideally, data generated through the use of NOpain would be integrated with an AYA’s electronic medical record to streamline care and communication across healthteams. However, this poses several changes including better securing of data stored on the phone, as well as potential security audits and verifications.
